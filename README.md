ANALYSIS:


From the 2021 June CitiBike csv file, the data collected included Lat & Lng Data, as well as unique ID's for trips and bikes. The csv file also included starting and ending 
destinations for each trip. 


There are slightly more members for the Citibike program than casual riders. From the data we can infer that casual riders who enjoy bikeriding will usually sign up to become
a member. The ratio between members and nonmembers is close to 50%.


The top 10 most popular starting and ending destinations are very similar to each other. This may be explained by people returning to their original location after their bike ride, or simply because there are only so many stations in New Jersey where this data was collected. 


Contrary to the point above, there are more ending destinations than starting destinations based on the map visualization. This could be due to the fact that people who do not return to their starting location will just drop the bike off at the nearest/most convinient location for them.
